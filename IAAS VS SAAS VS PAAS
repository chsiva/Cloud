IaaS vs. PaaS, defined

Typically, "IaaS" provides access only to core infrastructure components -- compute, networking and storage. 
Users install and manage the software they want to run on their cloud-based infrastructure."
Cloud providers (AWS/GCP/Azure) maintain and monitor the physical infrastructure to deliver IaaS, 
but it is the users' responsibility to secure and monitor the workloads that run on that platform. 
Thus, the primary value of IaaS is that it eliminates the need for users to purchase, set up and maintain physical servers.

Platform as a service (PaaS) provides infrastructure to host applications, as well as software tools to help customers develop and deploy those applications. 
PaaS simplifies the setup and management of both hardware and software.
PaaS is less flexible than IaaS, and typically caters to a narrow set of approaches to application development or deployment. 
They are not general-purpose replacements for an organization's entire IT infrastructure and software development workflow.
